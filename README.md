# Applitools Example: Playwright Python with the Classic runner

This is the example project for the [Playwright Python tutorial](https://applitools.com/tutorials/quickstart/web/playwright/python).
It shows how to start automating visual tests
with [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/platform/eyes/) classic runner
using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) in TypeScript.

It uses:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language
* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) as the core test framework
* [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) as the local browser for testing
* [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) for dependency management
* [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/platform/eyes/) for visual testing

To run this example project, you'll need:

1. An [Applitools account](https://auth.applitools.com/users/register), which you can register for free
2. A recent version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
3. A good Python editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
   or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


To install dependencies and set up Playwright, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

The main test case spec is [`test_acme_bank.py`](tests/test_acme_bank.py).

To execute tests, set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable
to your [account's API key](https://applitools.com/tutorials/guides/getting-started/registering-an-account),
and then run:

```
python3 -m pytest -s -v tests
```
